feat: Initial Android app setup with React Native, Compose, and Convex integration

This commit establishes the foundation for the ChilledMonkeyBrains Android application, 
implementing a modern tech stack with real-time data synchronization capabilities.

Technical Stack:
- React Native (latest) for cross-platform mobile development
- Kotlin 1.9.20 for native Android components
- Jetpack Compose 1.5.4 for modern Android UI
- Convex for real-time backend and data synchronization
- Android SDK 34 (target) with minimum SDK 21 support
- NDK version 24.0.8215888 for native development

Architecture & Components:
1. Android Configuration:
   - Gradle 8.1.0 build system
   - Java 17 compatibility
   - Material3 design system integration
   - Compose UI tooling and preview support

2. State Management:
   - ViewModel architecture with Lifecycle components
   - Kotlin Coroutines 1.7.3 for asynchronous operations
   - Compose state management for reactive UI

3. Backend Integration:
   - Convex schema for notes, blogs, projects, and tasks
   - Real-time data synchronization setup
   - Authentication system foundation

4. Project Structure:
   - Modular architecture with separate screens, components, and utilities
   - Clean separation of concerns between UI and business logic
   - Type-safe development with TypeScript/Kotlin

Dependencies:
- androidx.core:core-ktx:1.12.0
- androidx.compose.material3:material3:1.1.2
- androidx.lifecycle components (2.6.2)
- androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.8.1
- Kotlin coroutines
- Testing frameworks (JUnit, Espresso)

Development Environment:
- Configured for Android Studio
- Metro bundler integration
- Hot reload support
- Debug and release build configurations

Next Steps:
- Implement feature-specific branches
- Add comprehensive UI components
- Enhance real-time synchronization
- Implement full CRUD operations for notes
- Add authentication flow
- Implement offline support

This foundation provides a robust starting point for building a modern, 
performant Android application with real-time capabilities and a clean architecture.
